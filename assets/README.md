This is my first profesionally guided step into tidying up some code by at explicit code articles, sections, navs. Telling exactly what each tag is doing rather than creating a bunch of divs and creating what i want out of each div and calling what ever class or id i want it to be. 

I took existing prvided code and made it react to the page getting larger or smaller. I all also made the text get larger or smaller as it is used. 

I have 3 different screen settings. 1 at 1000 pixles and 1 at 600 pixles.

Most of the resizing is set at percentages so the boxes will be a percentage of the screen size rather than a fixed pixle size. 

When the screen is in 1000 the contents section and benefits aside change to 100% of the screen. The asside gets bumped to the bottom of the page.
